# Random Player Explosion plugin v1.0 for **Minecraft Spigot 1.21.4**(ru below)
## Have fun with friends during random explosions!
# **Localization**
## Theres a **DOC** if u want to make localization for ur **lang**:
- Go to ur server dir & then into explosion_locale folder(it should generate first time when server launches)
- Clone en_US.json & rename new file to ur lang's locale code. For ex.: ru_RU.json for russian. U can find all available codes in the [link](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language)
- Adapt locale message for ur lang(u can also place `$timer$` anywhere u want & it'll show timer. for ex. "explosion in `$timer$`" transforms to "explosion in 13")
- Reload ur server using /reload(no restart needed)
- If u've done everything correct u should be able to use ur lang localization
- If your lang doesnt load check if the locale code is correct. If an error still exists please contact me!
